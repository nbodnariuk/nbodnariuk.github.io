    <h2>Expertise</h2>
    <p>
      I am a physical oceanographer with a strong interest in geophysical fluid dynamics and the 
      application of mathematical methods to the study of the climate system. My current research focuses 
      on the dynamics of the double-gyre circulation from the perspective of dynamical systems theory. 
      I leverage concepts from algebraic topology to analyze the structure of the system’s attractors, 
      aiming to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive large-scale ocean circulation patterns. 
      As part of this work, I have developed my own numerical model of the double-gyre system, 
      which I wrote in the Julia programming language, to explore its nonlinear dynamics under controlled conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, I have worked extensively with oceanic and atmospheric reanalysis datasets to investigate 
      the influence of large-scale climate organization on regional dynamics, particularly over the South Atlantic 
      Western Continental Shelf. I apply statistical tools such as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF), 
      Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA), and related techniques to identify dominant modes 
      of variability and their spatiotemporal evolution. This work has included the analysis of interannual 
      variability in ocean circulation and its relationship to broader climate patterns, using reanalysis 
      data to bridge scales and uncover robust connections between global drivers and regional responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond numerical and theoretical work, I have been actively involved in field campaigns. My last campaign 
      focused on the deployment of surface drifters for Lagrangian experiments to characterize transport processes 
      and mesoscale dynamics in shelf and open ocean regions. Additionally, I participated in sediment sampling 
      efforts in the Río de la Plata estuary aimed at validating satellite observations of sediment content. 
      I also work extensively with satellite imagery, such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a products, 
      and apply techniques from dynamical systems theory, including Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) analysis, 
      to identify organized flow patterns and coherent transport features in the ocean.
